# Cursor Rules Location

This rule defines how AI-generated code should be annotated in the codebase.

<rule> 
## Rule Description

All AI-generated code should be clearly marked with annotations to:
1. Identify code that was generated by AI
2. Provide context about when and why the code was generated
3. Make it easier to review and maintain AI-generated code

## Annotation Format

AI-generated code should be wrapped with the following comment blocks:

```typescript
/* AI-Generated Code Start
 * Generated on: YYYY-MM-DD
 * Purpose: Brief description of what this code does
 * Generator: Cursor AI
 */

// ... AI generated code here ...

/* AI-Generated Code End */
```

## Additional Guidelines

1. **Date Format**: Use ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) for dates
2. **Purpose**: Keep the purpose description concise but informative
3. **Scope**: Each AI-generated section should be self-contained
4. **Nested Blocks**: If AI generates code within existing AI-generated code, maintain the outer block and add a new inner block
5. **Updates**: When AI modifies existing AI-generated code, update the date and add a "Modified on" entry

## Examples

### Basic Example
```typescript
/* AI-Generated Code Start
 * Generated on: 2024-03-16
 * Purpose: User authentication helper functions
 * Generator: Cursor AI
 */
function validateUserCredentials(username: string, password: string): boolean {
    // Implementation
}
/* AI-Generated Code End */
```

### Modified Code Example
```typescript
/* AI-Generated Code Start
 * Generated on: 2024-03-16
 * Modified on: 2024-03-17
 * Purpose: User authentication with additional validation
 * Generator: Cursor AI
 */
function validateUserCredentials(username: string, password: string): boolean {
    // Updated implementation
}
/* AI-Generated Code End */
```

## Integration

This rule should be applied:
- When generating new code files
- When adding new functions or methods
- When modifying existing AI-generated code
- In any language that supports comments

## Maintenance

Regularly review AI-generated code sections to ensure they remain relevant and up-to-date. Remove annotations if the code has been significantly modified by human developers.
