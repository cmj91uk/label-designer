# Tailwind v4 Import Rule

This rule ensures that the correct import syntax is used for Tailwind CSS v4.

<rule>
## Rule Description

When using Tailwind CSS v4, the correct import syntax must be used at the top of CSS files.

## Import Format

CSS files using Tailwind v4 should start with:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';
```

## Common Mistakes

1. Using `@tailwind` directives (v3 syntax):
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

2. Using `@config` directive:
```css
@config "./tailwind.config.ts";
```

## How to Fix

Replace any v3 directives or incorrect imports with the single v4 import:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';
```

## Integration

This rule should be applied to:
- All CSS files using Tailwind
- Both new and existing stylesheets
- Files that need to be migrated from Tailwind v3 to v4

## Maintenance

Regularly check CSS files to ensure they're using the correct import syntax, especially when:
- Creating new stylesheets
- Migrating from older Tailwind versions
- Copying styles from external sources
